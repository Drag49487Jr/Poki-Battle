<h3>Unsolved Problems</h3>
<p>1) You can logout however it takes you back to the home page but that page is replaced by the "PokemonBoard" instead of the "PokemonPage".</p>
<p>2) If you clicked the search icon twice it will cause an error saying "it can't map over an object".</p>
<p>3) If you create a team that team may not render right away so you might have to refresh the page to get the team you created back.</p>


<h3>Future Enhancements</h3>
There wil be a button called 'challenge player' where you can challenge somebody who is online to a pokemon battle. The one being challenged can either decline or accept it. If accepted they will be taken to a seperate page where they will battle. There will also be a feature where you can message your friends while you are on the website.
